# Fast-Food-Nutrition
In this project, I collected a fast food dataset and performed data preprocessing to ensure quality and consistency. Using the Elbow Method and K-Means Clustering, I identified that four clusters were optimal for our model. The data was then categorized into healthy and unhealthy food groups.

Visualizations created with Seaborn highlighted positive and negative nutritional levels, providing insights into which foods are healthy and which are not. The project concludes with actionable recommendations on food consumption based on nutritional analysis.
